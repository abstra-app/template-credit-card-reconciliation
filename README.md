# Abstra Template: Credit Card Reconciliation
by Bruno Kuntz â€“ CFO at [Deco.cx](https://deco.cx/)

## How it works:
This project includes a credit card expense evaluation system implemented using Abstra and Python scripts. The system integrates with Slack to send alerts for rejected expenses.

Integrations:
  - Starkbank
  - Slack

## Initial Configuration:
To use this project, some initial configurations are necessary:

1. **Python Version**: Ensure Python version 3.9 or higher is installed on your system.
2. **Environment Variables**:

  The following environment variables are required for both local development and online deployment:

  - `SLACK_BOT_TOCKEN`: Slack Tocken to send alerts on Slack about rejected expenses
  - `FINANCE_TEAM_EMAIL`: Email address for the finance team (or any other team responsible for verifying expenses).

  For local development, create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add the variables listed above (as in            `.env.examples`). For online deployment, configure these variables in your [environment settings](https://docs.abstra.io/cloud/envvars).

3. **Dependencies**: To install the necessary dependencies for this project, a `requirements.txt` file is provided. This file includes all the required libraries.

   Follow these steps to install the dependencies:

   1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
   2. Run the following command to install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
  
      ```sh
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
4. **Database configuration**: Set up your database tables in Abstra Cloud Tables according to the schema defined in `abstra-tables.json`.

    To automatically create the table schema, follow these steps:
  
    1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
  
    3. Run the following command to install the table schema from `abstra-tables.json`:
       ```sh
       abstra restore
       ```
   For guidance on creating and managing tables in Abstra, refer to the [Abstra Tables documentation](https://docs.abstra.io/cloud/tables).
5. **Internal Registration**: Team members and corporate cards (with card number as returned by API) need to be registered to the tables.
   
## General Workflow:
To implement this system use the following scripts:

### Getting New Expenses:
To retrieve and justify new purchases on corporate cards registered in the tables, use:
  - **get_new_expenses.py**: Script triggered by a new purchase on a corporate card, retrieving purchase details from the Starkbank API.
  - **justify_expense.py**: Script to generate a form requesting the credit card holder (as registered in the tables) to justify the pending expense and upload the purchase invoice, which is validated with Abstra AI.

**IMPORTANT:**
  - Check for recent changes to the StarkBank API;
  - Configure the Hook in your StarkBank workspace with your POST URL.

### Approving Expenses:
To retrieve and evaluate pending expenses, use:
  - **check_for_expenses_pending_approval.py**: Daily script to get expenses for evaluation.
  - **approve_expenses.py**: Script to generate a form where the expenses can be reviewed and approved/rejected.
  - **save_expense_to_payables_table.py**: Script to save approved expenses to the `payables` database.
  - **expense_reject_notification.py**: Script to send a notification on Slack about the rejection of an expense.
